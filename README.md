# Motion-Correction-Phase-Correlation
Standalone version of Matlab suite2p phase correlation motion correction, with subpixel registration
Includes a novel bidirectional correction algorithm which accounts for unevenness in bidirectional scanning offset along the scan axis. At least for Olympus 2p, this is quite helpful.
